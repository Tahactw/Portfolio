# Character Model

Place the `Meshy_Merged_Animations.glb` file in this directory.

The model should contain:
- Character mesh with consistent scale
- Three animations: "Idle", "Walking", "Running"

Expected path: `/public/models/Meshy_Merged_Animations.glb`

## Model Requirements:
- Format: GLB (GLTF Binary)
- Scale: 1:1 (no scaling needed in code)
- Animations: Named exactly "Idle", "Walking", "Running"
- Optimization: Keep file size under 10MB for best performance
